# StudyApp
The idea of the app was to create something that sync grades from Blackboard to Google Calendars and a prediction engine based
on previous acedemic performance. Essentially, you would receive your grades posted in Blackboard, and based off your performance
and the subject, it would recommend YouTube videos that would help the students understanding of the subject or section prior 
to an exam. It would also predict your future performance based off your past grades, and indicate the likelihood that you
meet your goals, as well as suggest a given amount of time you should study and on what days.

Unfortunately, the documentation for Blackboards API is sparse and convoluted. So accessing a students grades and course 
information proved extremely difficult and the app was abandoned.
